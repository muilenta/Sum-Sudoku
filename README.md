# Sum-Sudoku
Written by Tony Muilenburg back in like 2010
This is a simple little sum sudoku game I put together in my spare time for the Intel appup store.
Nothing much ever came of appup, so this app sat idle for quite a while.   
It was fun to write, and fun to play.
No popups were allowed for appup, so the game uses images that come move in front and behind for graphics.  
The latest version of Visual Studio should be able to upgrade the solution and compile it.
I included an Excel file I used to generate sudoku puzzles using macros.  
It should also have around 100 color maps for the 100 levels.
